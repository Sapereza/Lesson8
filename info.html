            <p>Here you will find up coming & current events for the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet games. </p>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Terra Raid Battles</h3>
            <p>What are Terra raid Battles?<br>Tera Raids allow four trainers to face off against a powerful Pokemon. All Trainers in a raid battle are allowed to seamlessly make moves throughout the battle rather than taking turns, like how the raid battles in Pokemon Sword and Shield worked.</p>
            <p>In these battles, Trainers will need to defeat the Terastallized Pokemon within a specific time limit. These Terastallized Pokemon are said to potentially have unique or rare Tera Type from the usual Tera Type available to the Pokemon.</p>

            <h2 id="nature" class=" font-bold text-2xl underline">Pokemon Natures & Stats</h2>
            <p>All Pokemon have a nature associated with them. The nature that a Pokemon has corresponds with two stats.<br>One Stat is increased by 10% and another stat is decreased by 10%. The chart below will show you which stats are influenced by which natures:</p>
            <div>
                <img src="images/naturechart.png">
            </div>

            <h2 id="berries" class="font-bold text-2xl underline">Pokemon Natures & Berries</h2>
            <p>As you know all pokemon have natures. These natures also affect the types of berries that they like. The chart below shows the flavors of berries that correspond with a nature that a Pokemon can have:</p>
            <div>
                <img class="w-52" src="images/berrieflavor.png">
            </div>
            <p>In previous games knowing what flavor of berry a Pokemon liked would impact how well a Pokemon would preform durning competitions. <br><i>*<b>Note</b> - competitions are different from Pokemon battles*</i></p><br>
            <p>In more recent games there are no competitions. However, the flavor of berry a pokemon likes is still important if you plan to use a berry as a held item durning battle.</p>
            <p><b>For Example:</b> If you have a Snorlax with a Careful nature than the flavor of berry it will prefer is Bitter. If you were to give it a berry to use that has a dry flavor than the Snorlax would become confused durning battle because it dislikes that flavor.</p>
            <h2 id="ivs" class="font-bold text-2xl underline">Pokemon IVs & Ditto</h2>
            <p>Individual Values, IV for short. Are very important when breeding strong Pokemon for battle that are the best of their kind.</p>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold">What Are IVs?</h4>
            <p>Individual values (Japanese: ÂÄã‰ΩìÂÄ§ individual values), are the Pok√©mon equivalent of genes. They are instrumental in determining the stats of a Pok√©mon, being responsible for the large variation in stats among untrained Pok√©mon of the same species. In the context of Generations I and II, which have a different IV system, IVs are also referred to as determinant values (DVs).<br><br>
                <p>The Stats of a Pokemon are as follows:<br>
                    <b>HP or Health Points | Attack | Defense | Speed | Special Defense | Special Attack </b>
                </p><br>

                Each of the six stats has an IV associated with it, with that IV coming into calculation alongside the Pok√©mon's base stats, Nature, and EVs to determine the actual stat number. A Pok√©mon's IVs are fixed when it is generated by the game (i.e. when it is encountered in the wild or given to the player by an NPC), and cannot be changed (although Hyper Training causes stats to become values corresponding the maximum IVs).<br><br>
                
                In the games, the term potential is often used to allude to IVs, such as by the stats judge. Shigeru Ohmori has stated that the reason EVs and IVs are hidden is because he prefers to think of Pok√©mon as "real, living creatures".</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-bold">How do you breed for IVs?</h4>
                <p>First you will want to start with a ditto<div><img class="w-40" src="images/Ditto.png"></div> that has 31 IVs in each stat. This is considered "Best" and ultimately makes for a perfect pokemon. You can see how to catch a perfect IV Ditto in the most current game <a class="text-linkcolor underline" href="https://youtu.be/RsoIY7Q1C48">here</a>. </p>
                <div><img class="w-40" src="images/stats.png"></div>
                <i><b>*Note*</b> It is rare to have all stats be perfect. In most cases you will have 5/6 stats say "Best" and that is still exceptional</i>
                <br>

                <p>Next you will want to give Ditto the held item <b class="text-red-600">Destiny Knot</b>.
                    <div><img class="w-72" src="images/dknot.png"></div>
                <br> Destiny Knot is used to control the individual values of Pokemon while breeding. If a Pokemon is placed into the nursery while holding a Destiny Knot, any eggs that are produced will have five of its IVs determined by its parents instead of three. This allows trainers to breed statistically perfect Pokemon much more easily than they could otherwise.<br>

                The five IVs that are determined by parents, and which parent the IV is drawn from, is random and cannot be influenced through items. Players can still progressively breed better Pokemon by hatching eggs, checking the IVs, and putting them in the nursery if they have better IVs then their parents. </p>
